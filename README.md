# libebook

libebook is a library to read metadata and content from ebooks (unprotected epub and mobi books only).

Mobi support is based on the MobiDoc class in [SumatraPDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html "SumatraPDF")'s code.

The original files are distributed under a Simplified BSD license, my files are under the GPL3 (see COPYING).

The library comes with two example tools:


    bookdump <ebook> <outdir>

and

    bookinfo <ebook>
